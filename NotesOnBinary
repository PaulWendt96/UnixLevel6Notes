Assertion: Binary numbers are structs of f(num) boolean members.
  
f(num: Integer) is a function that calculates how many digits are in a given integer. For instance,
  f(1001) = 4
  f(1010101010) = 10
  f(1) = 1
  
For instance, consider the number "10011101". This corresponds (theoretically) to

struct bin {
  bool zero = 1
  bool one = 0
  bool two = 0
  bool three = 1
  bool four = 1
  bool five = 1
  bool six = 0
  bool seven = 1
}

However, this structure can be changed arbitrarily by reducing the number of members in the struct and increasing
their range. For instance, we could also say

struct bin {
  int zero = 1001  // ranges from 0 - 15
  int one = 1101   // ranges from 0 - 15
}

Both structs have an equivalent amount of information, but represented in a different way.
